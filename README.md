#GamerTime

# Overview

With so many group messaging platforms, it can be confusing to know when other members in your team are free to game and what latform they are messaging on.
That is where GamerTime comes in. With the tap of a button you can let all of your group know you are free and ready to game!

# Development Environment

This project is written in JavaScript and uses React Native and Expo to build the project as an ios, android, and web app. There are requirements to use Expo and React Native, 
such as having Node.js and others. You can find the requirements and install instructions below. I recommend downloading the Expo Go app on your hone to run project simulations. 
This works and is availble on either ios or android. The IDE I used is Visual Studio Code.
